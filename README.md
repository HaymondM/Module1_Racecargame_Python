## Racecargame Python

This programs shows the use of a python library called python arcade. The program uses python arcade to make a simple racecar game where the player goes around a map to collect coins.

I also used a program to make the map which is called tiled.

This is a video of the program. I made this to show how to use python, the python arcade library, and a program called Tiled.
